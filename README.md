# The Business Verse-

The Data Provided By Our Stakeholder AtliQ Technologies, tells us a detailed story of how their hotel business is declining, the revenue they have generated on different services and how the property they hold are performing in different cities.
Lately Our Stakeholder Has been observing some decline in their revenue and other metrics, their competitors have leveraged finer business methods.
So AtliQ decided that they need to know full details and insight regarding important performance metrics of their business across their various services that they provide.
So for that insight their IT team felt that they need greater visualization to understand the problems and they hired a Data Analyst(Me) who will be able to help them by making sense of the data and crunching and drawing out the variable insights.
